# PoD Contract Specification Draft
## 1. Introduction

* ***Purpose***: Facilitate a blockchain-based ecosystem to reward and acknowledge developers' expertise in Web3 technologies.
* ***Scope***: Covers the entire lifecycle of developer engagement, including certification, token minting, delegation, rewards, and ecosystem sustainability.

## 2. System Overview

Network Architecture: Operates on the Ethereum blockchain, integrating with smart contracts for various functionalities like certification, token minting, delegation, and rewards distribution.

Contract Modules:
* Certification Contract
* Minting Contract
* Delegation Contract
* Rewards Distribution Contract
* Restocking Contract

## 3. Functional Requirements

- [] Certification Contract: Manages the issuance of on-chain credentials to developers who complete the certification programs.
- [] Minting Contract: Enables certified developers to mint PoD tokens, with logic based on their certification level and achievements.
- [] Delegation Contract: Facilitates developers to delegate PoD tokens to validators or entities, with flexible delegation preferences.
- [] Rewards Distribution Contract: Calculates and distributes rewards based on delegation performance and contribution to the ecosystem.
- [] Restocking Contract: Dynamically allocates PoD tokens, reinforcing the ecosystem's sustainability and growth.

## 4. Security Specifications

Smart Contract Audits: Regular and comprehensive audits to ensure contract security and reliability.
Authentication and Authorization: Robust mechanisms to authenticate and authorize participants, preventing unauthorized access.
Slashing Conditions: Well-defined slashing conditions for validators or entities that fail to meet performance or security standards.

## 5. Performance and Scalability

* **Transaction Throughput**: Must support high transaction volumes to accommodate ecosystem growth and active participation.
* **Scalability Solutions**: Implement scalable solutions like sharding or layer-2 technologies to maintain efficiency.

## 6. Governance and Upgrades

* **Governance Framework**: A decentralized governance model allowing stakeholders to propose and vote on upgrades and changes.
* **Upgrade Mechanisms**: Clear and secure processes for implementing upgrades to the contract suite.

## 7. Testing and Deployment

* **Testing Phases**: Extensive testing, including unit, integration, and stress tests, to validate contract functionalities and performance.
* **Deployment Strategy**: Step-by-step deployment plan, ensuring contracts are deployed securely and effectively with minimal disruption.

## 8. Compliance and Legal

* **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to blockchain and financial regulations, with mechanisms for reporting and compliance checks.
* **Intellectual Property Rights**: Clear delineation of intellectual property rights concerning the contract code and associated documentation.

## 9. Interface for Basic Implementation (v0)

### Overview

Version 0 (v0) of the Proof of Developers (PoD) contract suite aims to lay the groundwork for the ecosystem, focusing on the core functionalities: certification, token minting, and basic delegation.

### 9.1 Certification Interface

* `Function certifyDeveloper(address developer, bytes32 credentials)`: Records the developerâ€™s certification, where credentials is a hash representing their verified skills and achievements.
* `Event Certified(address developer, bytes32 credentials)`: Triggered upon successful certification registration.

### 9.2 Minting Interface

* `Function mintTokens(address developer, uint256 amount)`: Mints PoD tokens for a certified developer, with amount determined by their certification level and minting rules.
* `Event TokensMinted(address developer, uint256 amount)`: Announced when tokens are minted and allocated to the developer.

### 9.3 Delegation Interface

* `Function delegateTokens(address delegatee, uint256 amount)`: Enables developers to delegate PoD tokens to a delegatee, such as a validator or another entity.
* `Event TokensDelegated(address delegator, address delegatee, uint256 amount)`: Triggered when delegation is successful.

### 9.4 Query Interface

* `Function getCertificationStatus(address developer) returns (bool)`: Verifies if a developer is certified, returning true or false.
* `Function getTokenBalance(address account) returns (uint256)`: Retrieves the current PoD token balance of an account.

### 9.5 Access Control

Basic access control will be implemented to ensure that only authorized entities can perform actions, particularly in token minting and delegation.

### 9.6 Upgradeability

The contract will incorporate features for future upgrades, allowing for enhancement and expansion without losing existing data or necessitating a new deployment.
Implementation Notes
v0 serves as the foundation, prioritizing straightforwardness and essential operations to validate the PoD concept.
Contracts must be gas-efficient and secure, with robust error handling and validations.
Comprehensive testing is crucial to ensure the system's integrity and to mitigate risks.
This initial version is the stepping stone for adding more intricate features like refined delegation, improved rewards, and extensive governance in later versions.
