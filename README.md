DDN Contract Specification Draft
1. Introduction

Purpose: Describe the objective of the contracts within the DDN, emphasizing the aim to facilitate secure, efficient, and scalable blockchain solutions.
Scope: Define the extent of functionality, interaction, and integration of the contracts within the network.
2. System Overview

Network Architecture: Outline how the contracts will operate within the blockchain ecosystem, including their interaction with the Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Cosmos networks.
Contract Modules: Detail the specific modules or components of the contracts, such as token minting, delegation management, reward distribution, etc.
3. Functional Requirements

Token Minting: Specify the criteria and mechanics for generating tokens, including eligibility, minting rates, and limitations.
Delegation and Staking: Define the process for token delegation and staking, including the selection of validators, staking rewards, and governance participation.
Reward Distribution: Outline how rewards are calculated and distributed among participants, taking into account their contributions and network performance.
Validator Commission: Describe the commission structure for validators, including performance metrics, payout schedules, and slashing conditions.
4. Security Specifications

Smart Contract Audits: Mandate regular audits of the contracts to identify and rectify vulnerabilities.
Authentication and Authorization: Define the mechanisms for verifying the identity of participants and controlling access to contract functionalities.
Slashing Conditions: Specify the conditions under which participants may be penalized, detailing the procedures for detecting and executing slashes.
5. Performance and Scalability

Transaction Throughput: Set benchmarks for the number of transactions the contracts should support per second.
Scalability Mechanisms: Describe the approaches to ensure the contracts can scale with the network’s growth, including layer-2 solutions or sharding techniques.
6. Governance and Upgrades

Governance Processes: Outline the decision-making process for contract upgrades, feature additions, and network parameters adjustments.
Upgrade Pathways: Define the mechanisms for implementing contract upgrades, ensuring minimal disruption to the network’s operation.
7. Testing and Deployment

Testing Strategy: Detail the testing phases, including unit testing, integration testing, and stress testing, to ensure contract reliability and performance.
Deployment Plan: Describe the steps for deploying the contracts on the network, including any initial configuration and post-deployment monitoring.
8. Compliance and Legal Considerations

Regulatory Adherence: Ensure the contracts comply with relevant blockchain and financial regulations, detailing the compliance measures and reporting mechanisms.
Intellectual Property: Address the ownership and licensing of the contract code and related documentation.
